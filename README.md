## Hey there, Iâ€™m Rafe!

Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer and digital designer. I build front end systems for the web, specializing in scalable CSS and Javascript architectures and UI development. I cut my teeth as a [freelancer][rgd2], and I'm currently at [ReadMe] where I head up the engineering team.

Over my career, I've gotten to work alongside other amazingly talented development teams and design technologists to solve difficult user interface problems at scale. [**Check out some of my selected works over at RGD2**][rgd2]. Hit me up on on [GitHub] or [Dribbble]. Or catch me on [LinkedIn].
