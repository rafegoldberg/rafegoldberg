Nice to meet you. Iâ€™m a software engineer and digital designer. I build front end systems for the web, specializing in scalable CSS and Javascript architectures and UI development. I cut my teeth as a [freelancer][rgd2], and I'm currently at [ReadMe] where I head up the engineering team.

Over my career, I've gotten to work alongside some amazingly talented development teams and other design technologists to solve difficult UI problems at scale. You can [**check out my selected works over at RGD2**][works]. Hit me up on on [GitHub] or [Dribbble]. Or catch me on [LinkedIn].
